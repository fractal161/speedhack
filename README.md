# PAL Mode

Surprisingly, this is *not* just speedhack with 5/6 on. I have to change things like the gravity tables, and most importantly the entry delay timings. This has been minimally tested as of now, but the end goal is to be able to play TASes made for the original PAL rom, so that it may be a true alternative for people with access to only NTSC hardware.
